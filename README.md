My solutions for [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020), there are probably more elegant solutions but ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

To print the answer for a days puzzle (might be helpful for checking your answer before submission)

Open the browsers console on an [input page](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1/input)
and paste in this line
```
eval(await fetch('https://raw.githack.com/judaschwartz/AOC-2020/master/answers/day-'+window.location.pathname.split('/')[3]+'.js').then(r=>r.text()))
```
